The overall objective of this project on Men’s Tennis Grand Slam Winners (1950-2023) is to create an interactive and informative dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the history and trends in Men’s Tennis Grand Slam victories. By achieving these objectives, the project will contribute to a deeper qppreciation and knowledge of Men’s Tennis Grand Slam history and its key players. 
Through data visualisation and an interactive dashboard this project will:

    Enhance Understanding: Offer tennis enthusiasts, analysts, and historians an   
    easy way to explore and understand the data related to Grand Slam winners over 
    the decades.

    Identify Patterns and Trends: Highlight historical trends, dominant players,       and shifts in the sport over time.
  
    Provide Insights: Deliver valuable insights into player performance, the           impact of different surfaces, and the evolution of the sport.

    Engage Users: Create an engaging and interactive experience that allows users      to filter, compare, and analyze data according to their interests.

To use this use this dashboard, the easiest way is to click on the deployed link https://rachaelinnes.github.io/Project_3_Mens-Tennis/. This will take the user to the dashboard where they can commence filtering by "Tournaments" which will display key data about the winner and runner up. There is also a sunburst chart, whereby users can easily see Left and Right Hand players, clicking on any slice will display the players name. There is a bubble chart included that displays information about how many times players have won Grand Slam tournaments.  

In our data visualization project, we prioritized ethical considerations to ensure the integrity and fairness of our work. When undertaking this work we were keen to ensure that we embedded ethical considerations in each part of the process. This is outlined below;

 ### Data Collection: We acknowledge that the data used is from a public dataset from  
 Kaggle, the link is included to ensure transparency and ensure that users can     
 verify the data source. The Kaggle source confirms CC0 1.0 Universal licence,     
 and as such, means that creators have waived effectively placed this data int he 
 public domain, and as such this could be used for any purpose without 
 restriction. 
  
 ### Data Analysis:In using this data for our data visualisation project we were 
 committed to maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the data. We used a number
  
 Data Visualisation (Design):




Data came from a number of sources, they are:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wonduk/mens-tennis-grand-slam-winner-dataset, this dataset used sraping to collect data from the following sites: https://www.espn.com/tennis/rankings

### References Source Code
We used a number of sources to assist with the code for the visualisation design:

Apache Library: this was a new library used: for lines 41 to 114. A range of sources were used:
 - how to organise the "options" with sample code from:
    - https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-sunburst
    - https://codepen.io/pen
 - how the basic code structure works https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=sunburst-simple
 - chat gpt for help in organising the data into an array of nested objects
Gitlab: utilised code provided as part of coursework 
https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Monash-University/MONU-VIRT-DATA-PT-05-2024-U-LOLC

CoPilot and Chat GPT: used to assist with debugging and validate parts of the code.
